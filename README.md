### **Object of the Game**
To outsmart your opponent with a clever code or great guesswork.

### **Rules**

Your aim is to crack the code in the least number of attempts.

You get 8 attempts at breaking the code. If you can‚Äôt discover it by then then you lose that game. But that‚Äôs ok. You can get a new code and try again.

The Code Breaker code is made up of 4 to 6 colours from the 8 available colours. To win you must place the right marbles in the right order. After each attempt you will be told how you went.

* White marble - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code but not in the right place.
* Black marble - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code and in the right place.

The answer marbles are not in any particular order and don't line up with your code marbles.
